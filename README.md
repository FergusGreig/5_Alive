## Game Rules For reference
### Overview
The central theme is that you roll the dice until you either strike out or stop. You have 5 dice, every time you roll them you must score at least one die, scored dice are set aside and the remaining dice are then rolled. If all 5 dice have been scored you are then '5 Alive' and get to continue with all 5 dice again. In this way your score builds until you either fail to score in a roll (strike out) or you take the points. If you strike out then you score nothing for that turn and the next player starts on 0. If you take the points then you score the total for all your rolls that turn and the next player then has the option to 'keep it going' and pick up where you left off with the dice considered 'hot'. 

### Points system
- A 1 is worth 100 
- A 5 is worth 50
- A full straight i.e. 12345 or 23456 is worth 750
- three of a kind 1's is worth 1000
- three of a kind 2's to 6's are worth 100 times the number. i.e. three 4's is worth 400 etc.
- four of a kinds are worth double 3 of a kinds i.e. four 3's is worth 600, four 1's are worth 2000
- five of a kinds are ten times the three of a kind, i.e. five 2's is worth 2000.
- A roll of five 1's gives instant victory. 

### Other rules
The game is typically played as first to 10000. However once someone surpasses this, every other player get's one final turn in which to try to beat them.
Each player must initially roll at least 350 from scratch to get onto the scoreboard.
This means that 'hot dice' don't pass to playes that are yet to score.
